## Weather and Water Level Generators

This organization contains repositories for a weather generator developed by [Scott Steinschneider](https://cals.cornell.edu/scott-steinschneider)'s research group at Cornell University and a wave and water level generator developed by [Peter Ruggiero](https://ceoas.oregonstate.edu/people/peter-ruggiero)'s research group at Oregon State University.

The **weather generator** is described in the following incomplete list of publications:
